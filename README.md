#JOBHawk AI Agent

üßë‚Äçüíª User Story: JobHawk AI Job Tracker Agent
As a busy job-seeker,
I want an automated agent that checks job listings for specified roles across company career pages multiple times a day,
So that I can receive a regularly updated Excel-compatible file with relevant job openings that I can quickly review and apply to.
